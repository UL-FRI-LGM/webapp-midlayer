This repository references two submodules, both being implementations of web applications using a midlayer to separate application logic from the user interface. This alleviates several issues that arise from tight coupling, 

#RenderCoreEditor
RenderCore is a versatile rendering framework. As part of the thesis, a simple scene editor was developed for it, using the midlayer approach.
#VPT-WebGPU
VPT is a volumetric path tracing framework targeted towards interactive real-time data exploration, intended for web use. An updated UI, using the Tweakpane library, was developed for it.
